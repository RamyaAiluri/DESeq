# DESeq
# üß¨ DESeq2 Analysis Project

This project involves **differential gene expression analysis** using the **DESeq2** package in R. Below is an overview of the workflow implemented:

## üìå Steps:

### Step 1: Data Preparation
- Import raw count data and prepare it for analysis.
- Convert count data to numeric format and ensure proper structuring.
- Load metadata information with sample identifiers and conditions.

### Step 2: Creating a DESeq2 Object
- Construct a `DESeqDataSet` object from count and metadata.
- Define an experimental design with a factor of interest (e.g., control vs. cancer).

### Step 3: Normalization
- Estimate size factors to normalize raw counts.
- Retrieve and explore normalized expression data.

### Step 4: Statistical Modeling & Differential Expression Analysis
- Run the **DESeq** function to fit the model and extract differentially expressed genes.
- Perform contrast analysis to compare gene expression between conditions (e.g., `ctl` vs. `cancer`).

### Step 5: Exploration & Visualization
- Perform PCA to examine sample clustering.
- Generate **MA plots** for visualizing log-fold changes.
- Extract and visualize expression levels of specific genes.
- Adjust p-values for multiple hypothesis testing using `lfcShrink`.

### Step 6: Volcano Plot Generation
- Visualize significant differentially expressed genes with a volcano plot.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **R, DESeq2, ggplot2**
- **Statistical modeling & visualization**
- **Differential expression analysis**

This project provides insights into gene expression differences between conditions and serves as a crucial step in biomarker discovery and disease understanding.
